R Notebooks

This GitHub Repository stores my R Notebooks, allowing GitHub Pages to serve the R Notebooks on my website without me having to include a redundant, heavy `index.html` in every corresponding repository. All the notebooks will be served from a `/notebooks/` folder, which has SEO benefits as well.

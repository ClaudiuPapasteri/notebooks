R notebooks

This GitHub Repository stores my R Notebooks, allowing GitHub Pages to serve the R Notebooks on my website without me having to include a redundant, heavy `index.html` in every corresponding repository. All the notebooks will be served from a `/notebooks/` folder, which has SEO benefits as well. 

example GitHub folder: https://github.com/ClaudiuPapasteri/notebooks/r-notebook-template/

example GitHub Page: https://claudiupapasteri.github.io/notebooks/r-notebook-template/r-notebook-template.nb.html

Refer to the original repository for each notebook where appropriate. (most are licensed MIT)
